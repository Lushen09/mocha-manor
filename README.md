A simple yet elegant front-end for a coffee shop website. This project was created to apply my skills in order to build a full front end from scratch from a premade design. 
The website features a clean, modern design with a smooth user interface. Users can navigate through the various information pages on the website as well as view the menu on offer at
the coffee shop.
